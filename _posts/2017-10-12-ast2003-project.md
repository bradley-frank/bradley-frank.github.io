# Interferometer Arrays

In this group project, your team will be designing a radio antenna array (an interferometer). You
will need to balance a variety of technical and scientific constraints, and you will use a variety
of tools to design candidate arrays, simulate the operation and quantify the performance. 

Your telescope will be built to conduct a single survey for its operational lifetime, and the target
sensitivity of your survey is $$\sigma_\mathrm{survey}=10\mu\,\mathrm{Jy}$$. 

## Introduction
An ideal radio interferometer measures the Fourier transform of the brightness distribution from an
astronomical source. In practice, the convolution of the telescope's sampling function _and_ the
source's brightness distribution is measured. Image reconstruction is the process of _undoing_ this
convolution (or the Fourier multiplication), and is often referred to as deconvolution.

The telescope's sampling function plays a central role in image reconstruction -- you need as many
independent measurements as possible to reconstruct an image, but redundant measurements also help
with calibrating a radio telescope.  The resolution of your telescope is determined by the longest
baseline, so the longer the baseline, the better the resolution. You will find, however, that having
a single (or a few) long baselines is not sufficient to ensure good resolution -- you need many long
baselines, and you need many _intermediate_ baselines to provide good sampling of the Fourier
domain.  Finally, while higher resolution is a _good_ thing, you need short baselines to observe
extended sources (e.g., gas around nearby galaxies). 

Therefore, the design of a radio array is a fine balance between resolution and sensitivity.
Resolution motivates for long baseline, and sensitivity motivates for more antennas. 

## Your Project

Your objective is to design a radio interferometer. Your design will be constrained by scientific,
budgetary and technical considerations, so take note of the factors mentioned here. You will submit
your report as a scientific paper, and your team will present your findings at the project
conference. This is a research project, so please try to find important/relevant references where
possible.

## Groups
Each group will comprise 4 students, and it is expected that each student makes an equal
contribution to the project. Each group must nominate a group secretary, who will report on the
progress of the group. The secretary will take the responsibility of arranging group meetings, and
will represent the group's concerns and best interests.

Please watch the Vula site for more information on each group.

## What to Submit and Important Dates

* **Friday, 3 November 2017**: Submit your final configuration in a text file, and an advanced draft of your
  report in PDF format.
    * We will evaluate the performance of your configuration, and review your report for questions
      and comments that will be addressed at the presentation.
* **Wednesday, 8 November 2017**: Your team will present a 20-minute presentation
  (powerpoint/keynote). Each member will have to present for 5-minutes. This will be followed by a
  5-minute Q&A session.
* **Friday, 10 November 2017**: Submit the final version of your report in PDF format.

### Constraints
Your team has a budget of 125,000,000 credits (CR) to design an optimal antenna layout, and an
daily operational budget of 2,000,000CR. That is, once you have constructed your telescope, you will
have 2M-CR/day to operate your telescope. The following constraints apply:

* You have 5-years to build and operation your telescope.
* Each dish costs 100,0000CR to build.
* You will need some cable and infrastructure for each dish. For each dish, this infrastructural
  cost is 1000CR per metre away from the centre of the array. For example, the infrastructural cost
  for a dish that is 3200-_metres_ away from the centre of the array is 3,200,000CR.
* The maximum baseline cannot exceed 20km.
* The dish size is 12-metres. Therefore, the minimum distance between each dish is 12-metres. In
  practice, the real distance is slightly larger to avoid _shadowing_.
* Deduce/invent a way to measure _how well_ your radio array has reconstructed the test image, which
  is a measure of image _fidelity_. For example, the difference between the output image (i.e.,
  after imaging) and your original test image ought to be as small as possible. Another possible
  metric could be the ratio of the test and output images; perfect reconstruction would produce a
  ratio-image that is unity everywhere. In practice, neither metric will be perfect. There is,
  however, a task in CASA that will do an evaluation for you, and will calculate a fidelity image
  for you. Consult the guide on [simulating observations][casasim] for more details and ideas.

### Supplementary Material

I have provided a [Jupyter Notebook][jup-supp] that contains information and supplementary material for the
following constraints:

* Operational costs: The daily operational costs of a telescope are not constant as a function of
  time. In your project I have included a very simple relation on how the operational costs scale as
  a function of time. 
* Which $$T_\mathrm{sys}$$ value to use for your array, based on how many antennas you end up
  building. Providing cryogenic cooling for a large dish array is expensive business. While you can
  achieve a desirably low system temperature for a modest number of dishes, you will soon run out of
  funding if you start cooling a large number of dishes. Therefore, while it may be a good idea to
  build a huge numbr of dishes, you may not be able to cool them sufficiently to achieve a good
  sensitivity.
* Antenna efficiency as a function of build time. The build time for a dish varies from 0.5-2 days,
  with a 12-hour build time yielding antennas with the lowest efficiency, and a 2-day build time
  producing dishes with a 100% efficiency. This is a soft limit on the number of dishes that you can
  produce.
* How to calculate the sensitivity of your telescope for a given $$T_\mathrm{sys}$$ using the
  radiometer equation.

### Science and Sensitivity
Your telescope will be built to conduct a single large radio survey. You will need to finish this
survey before the end of the 5-year lifetime of your telescope. The target sensitivity of this
survey is $$\sigma_\mathrm{survey}=10\mu\,\mathrm{Jy}$$.

Since you are only observing a single channel, the sensitivity of your radio telescope is given by
the simple equation:

$$\sigma_\mathrm{survey} = \frac{1}{\eta}\frac{\sqrt{2}k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{sys}}{(N(N-1)\tau\nu)^\frac{1}{2}}$$

where $$\eta$$ is the efficiency of your telescope, $$\nu=10\,\mathrm{MHz}$$ is the bandwidth of
your single channel, and $$k_\mathrm{B}=1.38\times10^{3}\,\mathrm{Jy\,K^{-1}}{}$$ is the scaled
Boltzmann constant. 

The aim of your telescope is to achieve the target sensitivity. You will need to balance the system
temperature, number of dishes, efficiency and total observational time to achieve this target
sensitivity. 

$$\sigma_\mathrm{survey}$$ is a measure of the faintest source that you can measure with any degree
of confidence with your radio telescope. In practice, a multiple of this value is used as the
threshold for source identification, e.g., a $$3\sigma_\mathrm{survey}$$ source.

Please make note of the following important points for your project:

* Your telescope will be placed at the de-facto central position of the MeerKAT array. 
* The operational frequency of your telescope is 1.420-GHz.
* Your telescope will only be observing a **single** channel of 10-MHz.
* The `dummy-settings.txt` file that I have provided set's up observations for 2-hours/7200-seconds,
  with each integration being 10-seconds. Your integration time depends on the maximum baseline
  length! You can calculate this by looking at [Section 3.1. of the Essential Radio Astronomy][era3]
  course.

You will be using simulations to evaluate the imaging performance of your telescope. However, it is
unfeasible to calculate a simulation for the **full** duration of your observation (e.g., 2-years ~
20,000-hours). Therefore, to evaluate the performance of your telescope, for a given $$N$$,
$$T_\mathrm{sys}$$ and $$\eta$$ you can calculate the expected sensitivity for the typical daily
operational time $$\sigma_\mathrm{operational}$$, e.g., 8-hours. 

$$\sigma_\mathrm{operational}$$ is an important number to keep in mind; the faintest sources in your
mock image ought to be a few multiples of $$\sigma_\mathrm{operational}$$.

## Your Toolkit

All the software you require is available on the [https://arcade-jupyter-hub.arc.ac.za][arcade]
virtual machine. For this project, you will use the full suite of tools provided by Jupyter: 

* The Jupyter Notebook (Python 2).
    * For visualising your uv and image data.
    * Creating array designs.
* The Terminal.
    * Running CASA.
    * Finding/accessing your data.
* The File Browser.
    * Changing the settings file(s).
    * Looking at plots (if you export them).
    * Writing your own scripts.

The flowchart below illustrates a possible method for you to generate your test images, antenna
configurations and to evaluate the antenna array. 
![flowchart]({{site.url}}/assets/images/ast2003h-project-2017.png)

I have provided a few scripts and notebooks that will help with the simulation, imaging and
analysis.

* `dummy-settings.txt`
    * This is a settings file that is used by each of the CASA scripts that I have provided.
* `make_model.py`
    * This CASA script creates a _component list_ and constructs a model image, based on the source
      parameters in `dummy-settings.txt`.
* `make_sim.py`
    * Uses the CASA task `simobserve` to create a simulated measurement set. It creates a pointing
      file with a single pointing at the centre of your model, and creates the visibility data
      according to your observational setup, e.g., total time, number of integrations, etc...
* `make_image.py`
    * Uses the CASA task `clean` to image your simulated measurement. Remember that `niters=0` makes
      a dirty image, which is the equivalent of an FFT, and `niters>0` will _clean_ the image, i.e.,
      do deconvolution for `niter` loops.
    * Also uses `exportfits`, which exports a CASA image (a table) into a fits file.
* `plotting-image-data.ipynb`
    * Uses APLPY to plot the fits files. 
* `plotting-uv-data.ipynb`
    * Uses a package called `pyrap` and a customized languaged called `TaQL` to read the contents of
      a measurement set. I have illustrated how to plot a few important quantities.

The notebooks can be imported directly into your Jupyter Hub. The scripts, once they are in a
suitable directory, can be executed as follows, for example:

* You have to run CASA from within a terminal:
    ```python
    casa --nologger --log2term --nogui
    ```
* You can then run your script as follows:
    ``` python
    run make_model.py -s dummy-settings.txt
    ```


### CASA
[CASA][casa] stands for *Common Astronomy Software Applications*, and is a `C++/Python` package
designed by the NRAO to do calibration and imaging for radio interferometric imaging. 

[CASA][casa] is an object-oriented descendent of the classical NRAO software **AIPS**, and is
written in `C++`, with a `(I)Python` binding. You interact with and control the software using
the `IPython` interface, but the underlying software is compiled `C++` code. 

Each of the scripts that I have provided make use of CASA tasks, and you can use these tasks
directly, without the scripts.

* You have to run CASA from within a terminal:
    ```python
    casa --nologger --log2term --nogui
    ```
* To look at the current and required inputs of a task, `clean`, for example:
    ``` python
    inp clean
    ```
* To get help on a task:
    ``` python
    clean?
    ```
* To set parameters:
    ``` python
    niters=1000
    ```
* Whenever you run a task, either via a script or directly, a `.last` file will be created. For
  example, if you run the script `make_image.py`, a `clean.last` file will be created which contains
  the last values used for `clean`. You can _import_ those values into your current session as
  follows:
  ``` python
  tget clean
  ```
  or
  ``` python
  execfile('clean.last')
  ```
* Finally, if you choose to run CASA tasks yourself, you can save the commands/variables as follows:
  ``` python
  saveinputs(clean, 'clean.saved')
  ```
  You can retrieve the values from `clean.saved` by using `execfile('clean.last')`.


Please adhere to scientific best practices when writing your report. Use a suitable typesetting
software (e.g., LaTeX), and provide references to important literature.
