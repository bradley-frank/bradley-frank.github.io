A few months ago, Russ Taylor and I wrote an [Op-Ed][oped] on the opportunities that Big Data
presents in Africa. This article focused on our findings within the South African context, and I
wrote about my experience with the African Research Cloud Astronomy Demonstrator ProjEct, **ARCADE**.

The teaching and learning intervention didn't really start off as a specific case-study for big
data, or data intensive computing, or cloud computing. Indeed, the project didn't even start off as
an _intervention_, since I was aiming to solve a simple problem -- teaching my class of 50 students
how to do a straightforward statistical analysis on radio and optical images.

The students were from a variety of different social and academic backgrounds. The engineers had
experience to digital signal processing, while the scientists had just started learning about
Fourier Series. Some of our students had their own laptops and plenty of experience with computers;
others were only just developing their expertise in computing. Therefore, the challenge was to
provide each student with an...
