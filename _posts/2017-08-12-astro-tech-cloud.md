A few months ago, Russ Taylor and I wrote an [Op-Ed][oped] on the opportunities that Big Data
presents in Africa. This article focused on our findings within the South African context, and I
wrote about my experience with the African Research Cloud Astronomy Demonstrator ProjEct, **ARCADE**.

The teaching and learning intervention didn't really start off as a specific case-study for big
data, or data intensive computing, or cloud computing. Indeed, the project didn't even start off as
an _intervention_, since I was aiming to solve a simple problem -- teaching my class of 50 students
how to do a straightforward statistical analysis on radio and optical images.
