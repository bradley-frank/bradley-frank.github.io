Hi there! I am Bradley Frank, a South African Astrophysicist, with an expertise in Radio Astronomy.
I am a Senior Developer with the Science Data Processing Team at the South African Radio
Astronomical Observatory (SARAO, https://ska.ac.za), and a Senior Researcher and Project Lead with
the Inter-University Institute for Data Intensive Astronomy.

This website is my personal research space where I share highlights related to my work as an
astronomer. 

My work focuses on the evolution of galaxies, as observed via multi-wavelength missions, with an
emphasis on radio telescopes. I have lots of observational experience with optical and radio
telescopes. I learned how to observe with the old SAAO 20'' telescope -- climbing up a ladder with
a joystick and peering through an eye-piece to point it. My expertise with radio telescopes is much
more comprehensive. In the last ten years I've learned about radio astronomy by working on a variety
of projects: 

- Commissioned the Wits Rooftop Yagi interferometer, and winning the Frank Nabarro Memorial Prize
  in the process.
- Calibrated the 22GHz receiver on the Hartebeeshoek telescope with the late and brilliant Mike
  Gaylard.
- Helped commission the KAT-7 radio telescope with the MeerKAT team.
- Designed the MeerKAT antenna configuration. 
- Developed the calibration and imaging pipeline for the APERTIF project.
- Developing the big-data backbone for the data processing and science delivery for the imaging
  surveys that will be conducted with the MeerKAT telescope.

I am currently doing postgraduate studies in Engineering Management at the University of
Stellenbosch.
